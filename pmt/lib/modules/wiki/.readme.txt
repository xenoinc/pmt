Description:
  Wiki system for xenoPMT. The rules for this wiki system will
  be baised off of MediaWiki's syntax to keep compatability with
  one of the most common systems available.

  The syntax in Wiki is going to be the same Knowledge Base system (for now).
  However, the difference between the two are as follows
    1) KB is inteded for a single page use.
    2) KB URL titles are strictly numerical where Wiki has ASCII title.
