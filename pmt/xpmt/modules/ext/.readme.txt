./pmt/lib/modules/ext

This directory is used as an Extension for the modules so we don't cludder
up the main path. Rather than having your module and 'X' other files, for now
we are putting them in this sub-directory.

In the future each module will be contained in its own directory to keep
things nice and neat. That change is coming soon, just hasn't been tested yet.
