 * Description:
 *  Project RSS Feeds. Each project should be allowed its own
 *  RSS feed.. that is if you want it to. To edit this feature
 *  it is bascially like a diary entry and it just gets added on.
 *
 *  Probably should use the table PMT_MODULE_SETTINGS to cap off
 *  the Max_Days or Max_Entries as well as Enabling it the feature (?).
 *
 * Change Log:
