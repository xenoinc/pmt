./xpmt/modules/

This directory is used to house the modules so we don't cludde the main path
with your numerous other files. The goal is so that each each module will be
contained in its own directory to keep things nice and neat.

The 0.1 system automatically searches for either for 'ClassName.php' or
"ClassName/ClassName.php" to keep things simple.

In the future each module will be registered in the database and included via
user or system config.php ("./config.php" or "./xpmt/config.default.php").
During execution the system checks the manually included modules' header file
and tests against the database if it was installed and enabled. If it was not
then through the Administrative Panel (admin mod) the admin may install and
enable the module as well as set group permission levels.

That change is coming soon, just hasn't been tested yet.
