This directory contains the default project space for all new projects.

When added to the "projects.php" you can then work with you project
space.  This can be created using the admin panel which will generate
these projects spaces.

Just make sure that your project's XML file doesn't contain any errors.

| Usage |
.-------

The original intensions of this folder was to not provide a user interface directly
but only as a portal for applicaitons to verify if there is an update available.

Future intensions of this static folder will be for the following:
  + Provide GUI for users (and customers) to check check for product updates.
    Kind of like a "download central"
  + PMT to use this folder to check for it's own updates.

The GUI will be available in future versions. Currently this space is used
for internal & proprietary purposes at your own descression.
