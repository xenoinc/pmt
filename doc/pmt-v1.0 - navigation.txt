=====================

The product page is a general listing of the available products available to
your customers.  This is different from "Projects" in the sense that Projects
are internal items to be managed by your employees.  Where as your customers
should be creating Tickets for the Product list.

Also Products are used to track what your customers have purchased (and their
serial numbers) as well as how many.  "Product Inventory" is also manageable.
